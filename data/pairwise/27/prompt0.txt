On the steps of a colossal, crystal palace that shimmers under a triple sunset, a proud, winged queen passionately addresses her assembled court. Her iridescent wings catch refractive light from the prismatic spires as she gestures toward the horizon. Diverse mythical creatures—griffins with obsidian talons, centaurs bearing engraved armor, and dryads with bark-textured skin—fill the terraced steps in deep, staggered formations. The camera glides slowly upward, pushing in from a low angle, framing her against the triune suns in a single clean manner while capturing subtle tension in a centaur's tightened jaw and a dryad's whitened knuckles gripping her oak staff. Amber and violet hues from the alien sunset cast long, angular, hard shadows across the geometrically precise staircases with diagonal lines.
