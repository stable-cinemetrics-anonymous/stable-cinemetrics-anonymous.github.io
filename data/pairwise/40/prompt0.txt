On a city street illuminated by golden hour sunlight casting elongated shadows, a window washer methodically wipes a shop's panes in circular motions captured through a tracking camera movement on stabilizer. The medium lens maintains shallow depth of field at wide aperture, rendering the bustling sidewalk crowd as velvety bokeh while keeping focus razor-sharp on the squeegee's repetitive arcs. Cool ambient light reflects in the wet glass panes, creating liquid highlights that bloom with each rotation of the washer's tool, while a backlight position emphasizes the worker's silhouette against the translucent surface. Medium ISO preserves detail in both the sun-warmed brick facade and the chiaroscuro patterns of the window frames.
