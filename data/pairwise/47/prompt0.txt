Wide shot of a massive fantasy battlefield where diagonal plumes of smoke from burning siege engines cut through the composition, their ashen trails forming dynamic lines that draw the eye toward clashing armies of crimson-and-silver armored knights beneath a cold steel sky. Scattered fires blaze among fallen banners embroidered with shattered sigils, their embers mixing with ash that rains like morbid snowflakes. The text "The Final Stand" materializes in the brooding cumulus formations above, its letters disintegrating as the battle recedes into mist-shrouded hills littered with broken spears and phantom shapes still locked in eternal combat.
