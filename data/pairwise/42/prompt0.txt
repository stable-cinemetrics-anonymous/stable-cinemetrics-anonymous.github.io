A musician in a tailored waistcoat plucks notes from the air under the amber glow of a piano lamp, fingers lingering on polished ivory keys as the melody dissolves. Shallow depth of field isolates their hands against a Steinway grand piano's rich mahogany curves, the camera's gradual push-in magnifying vanishing vibrations in dust-moted air. Warm light casts elongated shadows across sheet music, each fading chord echoed through soft-focus velvet curtains framing the deep studio space.
