Close up on trembling, sweat-beaded hands illuminated by the cold glow of a digital timerâ€”its harsh red numerals casting jagged shadows across a labyrinth of metallic wires. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field with a medium lens, blurring the cluttered chaos of tools and manuals in the background while keeping the ticking countdown and quivering fingers in razor focus. A single LED side light throws hard shadows that stretch like accusatory arrows across the bomb casing, heightening the unbearable tension as the text "Choose Wisely" flares briefly in blood-red typography before vanishing into the humming darkness.
