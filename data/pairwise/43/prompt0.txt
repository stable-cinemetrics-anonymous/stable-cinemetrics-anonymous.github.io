A medium-full two shot of two young lovers standing under falling cherry blossom petals, captured with a soft depth of field using a wide aperture to blur the pink cascade into watercolor textures. The camera begins at a ground-level angle, slowly tilting up with a stabilized dolly movement that drifts closer to their intertwined hands, maintaining a low ISO for crisp daylight clarity as they gaze into each other's eyes with petals catching in their hair like fleeting moments suspended in time.
