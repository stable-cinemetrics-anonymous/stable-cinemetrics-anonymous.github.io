Inside a hospital delivery room filmed with a telephoto lens at wide aperture, medical staff surround a mother in labor in a medium-full shot. Using a high-angle dolly movement that slowly zooms in, all eyes focus intently through a soft depth of field, the foreground and midground gently dissolving as the camera isolates the newbornâ€™s first cry in a trembling close-up. Medium ISO renders muted clinical lighting with subtle grain, the framing tightening to an extreme close-up of tiny fists and tear-streaked cheeks, the unbroken shot sustained by a stabilized pedestal rig.
